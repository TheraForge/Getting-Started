# Overview<a name="Overview"></a>

**TheraForge** is an *open low-code* SDK for the *rapid application development (RAD)* of digital health solutions running on Apple iOS for the iPhone and Apple Watch.

It provides support for **offline-first** storage integrated with a **secure enterprise-grade BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service)**, which provides cloud connectivity, storage and synchronization to the apps.

It's the result of 1+ years of development and incorporates **250K+ lines of code** distributed into **7 frameworks**, with an associated **no-code template app**:

* A cloud client framework for interconnection to TheraForgeâ€™s CloudBox **serverless service (BaaS)**: [OTFCloudClientAPI](../../../OTFCloudClientAPI)
* Enterprise-grade digital health frameworks: [OTFCareKit](../../../OTFCareKit), [OTFResearchKit](../../../OTFResearchKit)
* Enterprise-grade persistent storage and synchonization frameworks: [OTFCloudantStore](../../../OTFCloudantStore), [OTFCDTDatastore](../../../OTFCDTDatastore)
* A templating framework for app customization and styling: [OTFTemplateBox](../../../OTFTemplateBox)

* A sample cloud-enabled app can be installed, used as development model and customized for **no-code prototyping**.

The client SDK also integrates with a **web-based dashboard** for medical data collection and display, patient/doctor interaction and virtual care management.

# Getting Started Guide<a name="GettingStarted"></a>

You can start using TheraForge for free and even contribute to its development on GitHub by opening issues and submitting pull requests.

TheraForge's main components are:

1. A powerful modular SDK for app development called [ToolBox](../../../OTFToolBox).
2. A multi-cloud backend service called CloudBox (see the [Cloud Setup](../../../OTFToolBox) section).
3. A web-based doctor/patient dashboard.
4. An analytics portal to review server- and client-related statistics.
5. A no-code template app called [MagicBox](../../../OTFMagicBox).

Hippocrates Technologies provides free and paid tiers for the use of the BaaS service. Request a quote for personalized projects and for co-development opportunities. You can use the *TheraForge Client Registration form* for your queries:

**[Submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYDEx-Cnja_YE6iUFs08pxxLThlV76TAJ2uB7ymuUXbky9iA/viewform)**

**Note: To create a cloud account to use with ToolBox or MagicBox (as described in the Cloud Setup section linked above), you can use the registration form to obtain an API key.**
